## Getting a Local Version
1. On [github](https://github.com/sblack4/major-viz) click `Fork`
2. It'll stick a fork in a book.  When that is done you should be at `https://github.com/<your-username>/major-viz`
3. Wherever you'd like the `major-viz` folder open your terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/major-viz.git`

** make sure to substitute `<your-username>` for your actual github username
** if you don't have git installed they have a nice GUI at [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/) so you don't have to do git command line stuff
